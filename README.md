# iOS-Swift-WTOnlineLinearRegressionDemo
A demo app for my [WTOnlineLinearRegression](https://github.com/wltrup/Swift-WTOnlineLinearRegression) library.

You tap to add a point, select an unselected point, or deselect a selected one. You can drag a selected point. You can pinch up or down to change the variance on the selected point. The regression line and the uncertainty area associated with it change as any of those actions take place.
